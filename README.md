# WordInspection

A program which to calculate the number of lines and characters taken from a new line delimited .txt file.

This program adds words in a .txt file to a List then returns info such as palandromes, words containing all vowels in the Finnish alaphabet, etc. from the word list. 

Note that the words.txt file is rather large and probably should not be directly opened.
